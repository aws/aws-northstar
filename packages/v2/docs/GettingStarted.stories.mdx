## Installation

### Use in your React Project

## Setup

At the very top of your application, import the NorthStarThemeProvider component and render the NorthStarThemeProvider component.

```jsx static
import NorthStarThemeProvider from '@aws-northstar/v2/components/NorthStarThemeProvider';

export default () => (
    <NorthStarThemeProvider>
        ...redux provider, Apollo client provider, react route...
    </NorthStarThemeProvider>
);
```

## Usage
Here is a quick example to get you started:

```jsx static
import React, { FC } from 'react';
import FormRenderer, { componentTypes, validatorTypes } from '@aws-northstar/ui/components/FormRenderer';

const MyComponent: FC = () => (
    <FormRenderer 
        onSubmit={console.log} 
        onCancel={console.log}
        schema={
            header: 'Data driven form',
            fields: [
                {
                    component: componentTypes.TEXT_FIELD,
                    name: 'email',
                    label: 'Email',
                    description: 'Email Address',
                    helperText: 'Enter a valid email address',
                    isRequired: true,
                    validate: [
                        {
                            type: validatorTypes.REQUIRED,
                        },
                        {
                            type: validatorTypes.PATTERN,
                            message: 'Invalid email address',
                            // eslint-disable-next-line
                            pattern: /^(?:[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*|"(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21\x23-\x5b\x5d-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])*")@(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?|\[(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?|[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]:(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21-\x5a\x53-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])+)\])$/i,
                        },
                    ],
                },
            ],
