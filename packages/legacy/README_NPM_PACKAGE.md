# NorthStar - Prototyping Design System

NorthStar aims to be the standard for rapidly prototyping intuitive, meaningful and accessible user experiences. It simplifies your work and ensures consistent, predictable experiences at scale for your customers. With NorthStar, you can focus on innovation and do more with less.

## Cloudscape Design System and NorthStar

On July 19, 2022, AWS released [Cloudscape Design System](https://cloudscape.design/) as open source. Cloudscape is a solution for building intuitive user experiences. It offers guidelines to create web applications, along with the design resources and front-end components to streamline implementation. While NorthStar is a design system to rapidly prototype user experiences, Cloudscape is a design system that is intended for use in production environments, beyond the prototypal phase.
