# About NorthStar V2

## NorthStar empowers you to rapidly prototype intuitive, meaningful and accessible user experiences at scale

NorthStar aims to be the standard for rapidly prototyping intuitive, meaningful and accessible user experiences. It simplifies your work and ensures consistent, predictable experiences at scale for your customers. With NorthStar, you can focus on innovation and do more with less.

Whether you are a  developer or designer, NorthStar will help you delight your customers from inception to Prototype.

## Vision

To be ** the ** holistic design system for rapidly prototyping rich, engaging user experiences, and allow easy transition from prototyping to production. 

## Benefits

1. Your customers are the primary beneficiary of NorthStar. Using a shared design language, screen flows and standardized components means they can quickly understand how they should interact with new UI experiences and features, decreasing the effort associated with feature adoption and confusion.

2. NorthStar provides out-of-the-box support for accessibility, responsive design, and broad browser coverage. 

3. Using NorthStar also benefits developers by reducing custom design and code, saving time, lowering effort, and decreasing complexity.

## Tenets and key concepts

#### 1. Convention over configuration. 
Eliminate the need for configuration, simplifying the developer experience, decreasing the time from design to implementation.

#### 2. Be opinionated as it accelerates development
NorthStar is a design system. It is prescriptive and should always care of the undifferentiated heavy lifting of CSS, layout and styling.

#### 3. Eat our own dog food
We consume what we produce. NorthStar should remain self-documenting, always include a storybook and allow developers to experiment.

#### 4. Growth through community
Actively encourage a broad open source community to accelerate the development of the system.

#### 5. Be a playground for experimental UI components 
Inspire innovation through user experience design

## The future of NorthStar
Looking to the future, NorthStar will continue to grow as a visual, design, and development system targeted at the delivery of intuitive, meaningful and accessible user experiences. We encourage you to contribute to the project. See our contribution guide [here](#/Contribution%20Guide).

## Cloudscape Design System and NorthStar

On July 19, 2022, AWS released [Cloudscape Design System](https://cloudscape.design/) as open source. Cloudscape is a solution for building intuitive user experiences. It offers guidelines to create web applications, along with the design resources and front-end components to streamline implementation. 
NorthStar V2 is built on top of [Cloudscape Design System](https://cloudscape.design/) to enable developers to rapidly prototype user experiences and allow easy transition from prototyping to production. 

## NorthStar v1 legacy

NorthStar v1 legacy, released on October 2020, was built using [Material UI v4](https://v4.mui.com/) as its base and provided approximately 50 components for building prototyping user experience. 
NorthStar legacy entered maintenance on March 1, 2023. 
During the maintenance phase, NorthStar v1 legacy will receive critical bug fixes and security patches only. New features will be developed exclusively for NorthStar v2 during the v1 legacy maintenance phase. 
On March 1, 2024, support will end for NorthStar legacy v1. 
Refer to the Migration tabs in this documentation site for more information on how to migrate NorthStar v1 legacy to v2.
