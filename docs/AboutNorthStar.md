## NorthStar empowers you to rapidly prototype intuitive, meaningful and accessible user experiences at scale

NorthStar aims to be the standard for rapidly prototyping intuitive, meaningful and accessible user experiences. It simplifies your work and ensures consistent, predictable experiences at scale for your customers. With NorthStar, you can focus on innovation and do more with less.

Whether you are a  developer or designer, NorthStar will help you delight your customers from inception to Prototype.

## Vision

To be ** the ** holistic design system for rapidly prototyping rich, engaging user experiences.

## Benefits

1. Your customers are the primary beneficiary of NorthStar. Using a shared design language, screen flows and standardized components means they can quickly understand how they should interact with new UI experiences and features, decreasing the effort associated with feature adoption and confusion.

2. NorthStar provides out-of-the-box support for accessibility, responsive design, and broad browser coverage. 

3. Using NorthStar also benefits developers by reducing custom design and code, saving time, lowering effort, and decreasing complexity.

## Tenets and key concepts

#### 1. Convention over configuration. 
Eliminate the need for configuration, simplifying the developer experience, decreasing the time from design to implementation.

#### 2. Be opinionated as it accelerates development
NorthStar is a design system. It is prescriptive and should always care of the undifferentiated heavy lifting of CSS, layout and stlying.

#### 3. Eat our own dog food
We consume what we produce. NorthStar should remain self-documenting, always include a storybook and allow developers to experiment.

#### 4. Growth through community
Actively encourage a broad open source community to accelerate the development of the system.

## The future of NorthStar
Looking to the future, NorthStar will continue to grow as a visual, design, and development system targeted at the delivery of intuitive, meaningful and accessible user experiences. We encourage you to contribute to the project. See our contribution guide [here](#/Contribution%20Guide).
